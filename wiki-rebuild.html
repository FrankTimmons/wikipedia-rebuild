              The Seagram Building is a 38-story skyscraper at 375 Park Avenue, located between 52nd and 53rd Streets in the neighborhood of Midtown Manhattan in New York City. It was the headquarters of the Seagram Company, a Canadian distiller, until 2001. It was designed by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, Philip Johnson, Ely Jacques Kahn, and Robert Allan Jacobs in the International Style, and completed in 1958. Measuring 515 feet (157 m) tall, it has a glass curtain wall exterior with vertical mullions of bronze and horizontal spandrels made of Muntz metal. A pink granite plaza with two fountains faces Park Avenue; its construction helped influence a zoning ordinance that allowed developers to construct additional floor area in exchange for including plazas outside their buildings. Since 2000, Aby Rosen's RFR Holding has owned the Seagram Building. Elements of it were designated official city landmarks in 1989; the building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2006. (Full article...)
